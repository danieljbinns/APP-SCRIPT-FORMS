Logic

The basic idea is that almost every Yes/No question has conditional formatting. In this i’m only adding the questions that have conditional triggers

1. Employee Request Form (Requester)
a. Have all Recruiting Requirements been met? (Yes/No)
i. Yes: If yes, then proceed to next question
ii. No: If no, then the user gets a message saying something like “Please ensure all recruiting requirement have been met, then try again”
b. Access / Equipment Needed (Checkboxes. 
For each option that's been checked, the consequent questions for that option appear, if not checked, keep hidden.
i. Business Card
1. 
ii. 30-60-90
iii. ADP Manager Access
iv. BOSS
v. JONAS Purchasing
vi. Mobile / Web Applications (SiteDocs, Incidents, Delivery, Audit etc.)
vii. Fleetio / Vehicle
viii. Credit Card
ix. Google Account
x. Delivery App
