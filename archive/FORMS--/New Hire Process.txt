        T1




1. Recruitment Process is completed
   1. Eligibility for hiring is validated
These steps occur before our process, but before starting our process the submitter must confirm those processes are complete. 
1. Request initiation
2. Request Review (HR) and Request Employee Set-up (parallel) 
3. .
   1. Request initial employee set up | These are not in-order, they may have dependencies and each has a workflow that we need to document.  
      1. DSS training accounts (Workflow TBD)
      2. Sitedocs (Workflow TBD)
      3. Internal employee id (Workflow TBD)[a]
   2. Send paperwork to HR department [b]
4. . 
   1. Employee completes training 
   2. HR approves paperwork[c]
5. .
   1. HR sends request to Payroll to add new hire to ADP[d] (this can have multiple tasks under it, some mandatory) (adding emp could be a separate branch) 
   2. Initiate other requests
      1. IT / system requests
      2. Vehicle request initiated
      3. Credit Card request initiated[e]
6. .
   1. Payroll adds to ADP
   2. Any requests for IT department are initiated 
      1. IT processes current WMAR form (this creates a branch, lets call it “IT 1”, we’ll figure it out tomorrow) (this also initiates other work flows in parallel)[f]
7. .
   1. Payroll sends ADP number to HR
   2. IT communicates credentials to form initiator/new hire (This is the last step of “IT 1” there more stuff in between)  
8. HR sends ADP info to form initiator (this relates to 7a)
9. HR confirms form is complete
10. Initiator confirms form is complete
11. HR sends communication to company (depends on role)

Digitized New Hire Onboarding Workflow
Process 1: Initiation & Data Aggregation
This initial process is focused on a single goal: collecting all the required information in a structured way so the system can automate the rest of the workflow.
      * Tasks:
      1. Attest Pre-Hiring Checks Complete: A mandatory checkbox for the Requester to confirm that recruitment and eligibility validation are done.
      2. Aggregate New Hire Data: The Requester fills out the single dynamic form. The output of this task is a "New Hire Request" data object containing all the information needed for every subsequent step.
      * Developer's Note: By treating data collection as a single task that creates one master data object, we ensure that every following process has all the information it needs without having to ask for it again. This is the foundation of the entire automation.
Process 2: HR & Payroll Foundation
This process establishes the employee's official identity within the company's core administrative systems. It is the first major administrative milestone.
      * Tasks:
      1. HR: Validate Request & Assign Employee ID: The request is automatically routed to HR. An HR team member reviews the data, validates it, and enters the official "Associate ID / Employee #".
      2. HR: Trigger Payroll Setup: Upon saving the Employee ID, the system automatically notifies the Payroll department and provides them with the necessary new hire data.
      3. Payroll: Add Employee to ADP: A Payroll team member's task to create the employee's profile in the ADP system.
      4. Payroll: Return ADP Number to System: Once the ADP profile is created, the Payroll team member enters the new ADP number into their task, which updates the central record.
Process 3: Parallel Provisioning
This is the core of the automated workflow. As soon as Process 2, Task 1 is complete, the system triggers several sub-processes simultaneously. This parallel execution is the key to an efficient onboarding.
      * Developer's Note: We don't wait for Payroll to finish before starting IT and other tasks. The Employee ID from HR is the only prerequisite. This saves a tremendous amount of time.
      * Sub-Process 3a: IT Provisioning
      * Tasks:
      * Create Google Workspace Account
      * Create BOSS Account
      * Create Jonas Account
      * Provision Computer Hardware
      * Provision Mobile Phone Hardware
      * Assign Microsoft 365 License
      * Notify Safety Team of IT Completion (An automated signal sent when all other IT tasks are done).
      * Sub-Process 3b: Fleet Provisioning (Conditional)
      * Developer's Note: This entire process only gets created if the "Vehicle Assigned" field in the initial data object is 'Yes'.
      * Tasks:
      * Assign Vehicle Details (TRU, VIN)
      * Create Fleetio Account
      * Notify Safety Team of Fleet Completion (An automated signal).
      * Sub-Process 3c: Independent Onboarding Tasks
      * Tasks:
      * Manager: Draft 30-60-90 Day Plan (Assigned to the new hire's manager).
      * Employee: Complete & Submit HR Paperwork (Assigned to the new hire's personal email).
      * Admin: Order Business Cards (Assigned to an Office Administrator).
Process 4: Final Access & Safety Setup
This process acts as a "gate" or synchronization point. It cannot begin until it receives the completion signals from the provisioning processes.
      * Developer's Note: This is a critical dependency management step. The system will automatically hold these tasks until it receives the "completion" signals from both the IT and Fleet sub-processes.
      * Tasks:
      1. Await Provisioning Completion Signals: A system task that listens for the "Notify Safety" signals from Process 3a and 3b.
      2. Safety: Create DSS+ Account
      3. Safety: Create Sitedocs Account
Process 5: Finalization & Communication
This final process is responsible for distributing all the newly created information and officially closing out the onboarding request.
      * Tasks:
      1. Distribute System Credentials: The system securely sends usernames and temporary passwords to the new hire and their manager.
      2. Distribute ADP Information: HR receives a notification that the ADP number is available and forwards it to the initiator.
      3. Generate & Distribute Final Onboarding Report: Once all processes are complete, the system automatically generates a PDF summary of the entire request—what was requested, what was created, and who completed each step. This report is emailed to the Requester, HR, and IT.
      4. HR: Announce New Hire to Team: The final task for HR to send the welcome announcement to the broader team.

________________
Detailed Functional Requirements
Please implement the following logic within the <script> tag of the provided HTML.
      1. Central Data Management & Rendering:
      * On DOMContentLoaded, load the process data. Check localStorage first for a key named savedWorkflow. If it exists, JSON.parse() it and use it. If not, use a deep copy of the initialProcessData.
      * Create a single master function, renderWorkflow(). This function will be responsible for clearing the #workflow-container and completely rebuilding the entire HTML view from the current state of the data object.
      * Crucially, create a saveAndRerender() function. This function must first save the current data object to localStorage (as a string) and then call renderWorkflow(). This will be the main function called after any user action.
      2. Content Editing (Text):
      * When rendering, all process/task titles and descriptions should have the contenteditable="true" attribute.
      * Attach a blur event listener to these editable elements. On blur, update the corresponding property in the JavaScript data object and then call saveAndRerender().
      3. Structural Editing (Adding Items):
      * Add Process: The main #addProcessBtn button, when clicked, should add a new, blank process object to the processes array in your data model. It should have a unique ID, a default name like "New Process," and an empty tasks array. Then call saveAndRerender().
      * Add Task: Inside the renderWorkflow function, each rendered process header must include an "Add Task" button (<div class="add-btn">+</div>). When clicked, it should find the corresponding process in the data object, add a new blank task to its tasks array, and then call saveAndRerender().
      4. Structural Editing (Deleting Items):
      * Delete Process & Task: Each process header and each task card must include a "Delete" button (<div class="delete-btn">❌</div>).
      * When a delete button is clicked, use window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this item?') to ask for confirmation.
      * If confirmed, remove the corresponding object (either a process from the main array or a task from its parent's tasks array) from the data model. Then call saveAndRerender().
      5. Reset Functionality:
      * The #resetButton should, when clicked, remove the savedWorkflow key from localStorage and then reload the page (location.reload()). This will revert all changes back to the original state.
The core logical flow of the application should always be:
User Action (edit, add, delete) → Update the JavaScript Data Object → Call saveAndRerender()
Please provide the final, complete index.html file with the fully implemented JavaScript logic.

. 
under "form submitted" add "pre=requisites not met"
"send paperwork to hr" is part of "hr review"
make drag to re-order
if process halted, nothing happens
IT Verification triggers vehicle and credit car
P5, P8, P9, and new for credit card all get triggered by P2
In parallel after HR approves, CC, Vehicle, IT and Purchasing Accounts happen




[a]Request set-up step
[b]Part of Request review
[c]Can be indepent, and works parallely
[d]if the previous two arent done, this wont happen. This is also a process with many steps
[e]These 3 are also processes, each with tasks
[f]IT Team @dbinns@team-group.com , need to define this on monday
