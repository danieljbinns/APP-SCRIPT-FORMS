# DEMO Folder

## Purpose
**Senior meeting presentation materials** - Contains latest/best examples of desired final product for the New Employee Workflow.

## Status
**Reference/Archive** - These files were used to present project status and plan to senior leadership.

## Important Notes
- May contain the most current/polished versions of UI/UX designs
- These examples represent what we want for final products
- **Keep as reference until we confirm originals exist elsewhere**
- If/when original production versions are found, this folder may be archived or removed
- Do NOT delete without confirming these examples exist in the production codebase

## Key Files

### Main Workflow Entry Points
- **index.html** - Initial employee request form (workflow initiator)
- **dashboard.html** - Single workflow dashboard showing all tasks

## Why This Folder Exists
Used in senior meeting to demonstrate:
- Workflow initiation and tracking
- Task management approach
- Dashboard views (workflow-level and admin-level)
- Admin capabilities (filtering, reminders, bulk actions)
- Overall system vision and architecture

## Next Steps
1. Review against production codebase to identify what needs to be migrated
2. Confirm if better/newer versions exist elsewhere
3. Merge useful elements into main codebase
4. Archive this folder once content is preserved elsewhere
