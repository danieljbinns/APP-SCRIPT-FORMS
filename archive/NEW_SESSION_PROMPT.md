## Prompt for New Session:

```
I'm continuing work on the REQUEST_FORMS project for Team Group Companies. This is a Google Apps Script workflow management system with professional error handling and validation features.

IMPORTANT - Verify Environment:
- Current directory should be: P:\Repos\github\danieljbinns\APP SCRIPT FORMS
- Git branch should be: main
- Remote should be: https://github.com/danieljbinns/APP-SCRIPT-FORMS.git

Please verify the above, then read START_NEW_SESSION_HERE.md for complete project context.

Project Status:
- Repository fully consolidated (3 sources merged)
- All features implemented and documented
- Ready for testing/deployment phase

What I want to do this session:
[CHOOSE ONE - DELETE THE OTHERS]

Option A - Begin Testing:
Follow the comprehensive testing workflow in REQUEST_FORMS/REVIEW_PROCESS.md (7 phases) or docs/WEEKLY_REVIEW_PLAN.md (week-long structured testing). Start with Phase 1: Environment Setup & Verification.

Option B - Continue Feature Development:
Review the feature roadmap in DEMO/planning/00-MASTER-PLAN.md. Next priorities are P1-03 (Mobile Responsive Design) and P1-04 (Export Functionality). Help me implement the next feature.

Option C - Deploy to Production:
Review REQUEST_FORMS/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md and help me deploy the REQUEST_FORMS Apps Script project to production. Guide me through the deployment process.

Option D - Code Review:
Review the codebase for code quality, best practices, and potential improvements. Focus on REQUEST_FORMS/ workflow system and DEMO/shared/ validation modules.

Option E - Documentation:
Help me improve or update documentation. Review existing docs and suggest improvements or create additional guides as needed.

Please confirm you've read START_NEW_SESSION_HERE.md and understand the project structure, then proceed with my selected option above.

## Tips for New Session

1. **Always start by reading START_NEW_SESSION_HERE.md** - It has complete context
2. **Verify environment first** - Ensure correct directory and branch
3. **Choose one clear goal** - Testing, development, deployment, etc.
4. **Reference key documents** - Claude can read them for context

## Alternative: Minimal Prompt

If you want a shorter prompt:

```
Continue work on REQUEST_FORMS project. Verify I'm in P:\Repos\github\danieljbinns\APP SCRIPT FORMS on branch main. Read START_NEW_SESSION_HERE.md for full context, then help me [begin testing / continue development / deploy to production].
```
